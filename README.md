## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

Before you download and run the bot, make sure you have the following:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Node.js:** Version 14 or later installed on your machine. Node.js allows JavaScript applications to run outside of a web browser.
- **Discord Account:** You will need a Discord account to interact with the bot.
  
If you don't have Node.js, you can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps

1. **Download the Bot:**
   Visit [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/angelocun/Bot-discord/releases) and choose the latest version. This will let you download the necessary files for the bot.

2. **Extract Files:**
   Once downloaded, find the ZIP file in your downloads folder. Right-click on it and select "Extract All" or use your preferred extraction tool.

3. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:**
   - **Windows:** Search for "cmd" in the Start menu and open it.
   - **macOS:** Open "Terminal" from your Applications folder.
   - **Linux:** Use your default terminal application.

4. **Navigate to the Bot Folder:**
   In your terminal or command prompt, use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you extracted the files. For example:
   ```
   cd path_to_your_extracted_folder
   ```

5. **Install Required Packages:**
   Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command will fetch all required dependencies for the bot to function correctly.

6. **Set Up Your Bot:**
   You need to create a configuration file to set up your bot. Open the `config.json` file in a text editor. 

   Here‚Äôs a basic format you should follow:
   ```json
   {
       "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
       "prefix": "!",
       "ownerID": "YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID"
   }
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with your unique Discord bot token and `YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID` with your Discord user ID. 

   To create a bot token:
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Create a new application.
   - Go to the "Bot" section and click "Add Bot".
   - Copy the token and paste it into your `config.json`.

7. **Run the Bot:**
   Finally, to start the bot, run the following command:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```
   If everything is set up correctly, the terminal will display a confirmation that the bot is online.
